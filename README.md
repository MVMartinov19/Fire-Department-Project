<p align="center">1. The main idea of our project is to make site that can help the firemans in the Burgas and its region. The goal is to give information about employees, accidents, fire trucks, fire extinguishers and also to make registration of an accident. </p>

<p align="center"> <i> To make this site we have to use HTML&CSS&JavaScript. </i> </p>

<h1 align="center"> ðŸ’«The realization of our projectðŸ’« </h1>

<p align="center"> <b> First and the most important thing in this project is to make useful user-friendly site. </b> </p>
<p align = "center">Personally our site went through 4 stages of design. Here they are:</p>
<br>
<h3>1. The design with orange-red range</h3>

<h3>2. The design with range of shades of blue</h3>

<h3>3. Totally new design with range of shades of black and gray</h3>

<h3>4. The final result - instead of color range, we added backgrounds</h3>

<h3>Home page</h3>

<h3>Statistics' pages</h3>
<p>They both look the same. but with different photos and information. In these pages we have cards of the most bad accidends and the most participated employees in accidents. In the end we have table with all the information.</p>

<h3>Registration and registered accidents</h3>
<p>We also made an accident registration, but this page we leave it to you to examine it. When we have registered accidents they will appear in registered accidents page in the form of table. Have in mind that when we don't have a registered accident, a message will appear.<p>
